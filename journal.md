# Journal of thoughts during Te Hiku Media coding exercise

The intent of this journal is to document my stream of concious thoughts throughout the Te Hiku Media coding exercise so I can share my thought process with the assessment team afterwards.

- 25 March @ 5:25pm - Created this journal document
- 25 March @ 5:30pm - Added `requirements.txt` file with `pytest` as only dependency
- 25 March @ 5:30pm - Added `pyproject.toml` file to set up a Python project with `src` and `test` subdirectories
- 25 March @ 5:30pm - Created a python virtual environment, activated it and installed the requirements file to get `pytest` installed
- 25 March @ 5:30pm - Tested `pytest` command words
- 25 March @ 5:35pm - Added a placeholder readme with setup and testing instructions for the project
- 25 March @ 5:40pm - Created new git repository
- 25 March @ 5:40pm - Added generic python gitignore file
- 25 March @ 5:40pm - Pushed new project to my GitHub
- 25 March @ 5:50pm - Add `black` formatter to dependencies and install it
- 26 March @ 9:00am - Received programming test document link
- 26 March @ 9:00am - Reviewing Tic Tac Toe google document with test instructions
- 26 March @ 9:05am - Confirmed with Keoni that I received instructions
- 26 March @ 9:10am - Getting started on exercise using my existing project setup
- 26 March @ 9:10am - I figure I need a way to print out a Tic Tac Toe board. I will start with writing a unit test to expect an empty board to be returned.
- 26 March @ 9:10am - Grabbed a sample test fixture from my coding kata project to get me started (I can never remember the boilerplate for tests off the top of my head).
